<h2>JavaScript Class Inheritance</h2>

<p>Use the "extends" keyword to inherit all methods from another class.</p>
<p>Use the "super" method to call the parent's constructor function.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
class Car { //Defining class car 
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand; 
  }
  present() { //Created a method called present 
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() { //creating a show method 
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model; //references the "I have a ford" from the present method then concatinates the ', it is a ' and finally concatinates the this.model which reffers to the mycar model below which is a Mustang
  }
}

mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang"); //create a object called mycar based on car class extended by model class
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = mycar.show(); //called the show method while referring to mycar
